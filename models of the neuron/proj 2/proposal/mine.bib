abstract = { In Caenorhabditis elegans, spatial orientation behavior in a chemical gradient (chemotaxis) involves bouts of turning (pirouettes) modulated by the change in concentration of attractant. Ablation of identified neurons has delineated a candidate neural network for chemotaxis in C. elegans. The aim of our research is to generate testable models of how the network computes behavioral state and consequently, turning frequency, in response to changes in concentration. We were able to train neural networks to exhibit known chemotaxis rules using experimental data from chemotaxing C. elegans. The resultant network solutions involved three to five dynamically contributing neurons. Here we have analyzed the three neuron solutions and found three distinguishing features: a fast excitatory and delayed inhibitory connection, which acts as a differentiator; self-connections, which act to regulate neural response speed similar to synaptic time-constants; and recurrent inhibitory connections, which regulate second order network response characteristics. We plan to use this model to predict and interpret the results of laser ablations of neurons and genetic mutation in the C. elegans chemotaxis network.},

@article{Prinz2004,
abstract = {It is often assumed that cellular and synaptic properties need to be regulated to specific values to allow a neuronal network to function properly. To determine how tightly neuronal properties and synaptic strengths need to be tuned to produce a given network output, we simulated more than 20 million versions of a three-cell model of the pyloric network of the crustacean stomatogastric ganglion using different combinations of synapse strengths and neuron properties. We found that virtually indistinguishable network activity can arise from widely disparate sets of underlying mechanisms, suggesting that there could be considerable animal-to-animal variability in many of the parameters that control network activity, and that many different combinations of synaptic strengths and intrinsic membrane properties can be consistent with appropriate network performance.},

@article{White1986,
abstract = {The structure and connectivity of the nervous system of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has been deduced from reconstructions of electron micrographs of serial sections. The hermaphrodite nervous system has a total complement of 302 neurons, which are arranged in an essentially invariant structure. Neurons with similar morphologies and connectivities have been grouped together into classes; there are 118 such classes. Neurons have simple morphologies with few, if any, branches. Processes from neurons run in defined positions within bundles of parallel processes, synaptic connections being made en passant. Process bundles are arranged longitudinally and circumferentially and are often adjacent to ridges of hypodermis. Neurons are generally highly locally connected, making synaptic connections with many of their neighbours. Muscle cells have arms that run out to process bundles containing motoneuron axons. Here they receive their synaptic input in defined regions along the surface of the bundles, where motoneuron axons reside. Most of the morphologically identifiable synaptic connections in a typical animal are described. These consist of about 5000 chemical synapses, 2000 neuromuscular junctions and 600 gap junctions.},

abstract = {We pursue the hypothesis that neuronal placement in animals minimizes wiring costs for given functional constraints, as specified by synaptic connectivity. Using a newly compiled version of the Caenorhabditis elegans wiring diagram, we solve for the optimal layout of 279 nonpharyngeal neurons. In the optimal layout, most neurons are located close to their actual positions, suggesting that wiring minimization is an important factor. Yet some neurons exhibit strong deviations from "optimal" position. We propose that biological factors relating to axonal guidance and command neuron functions contribute to these deviations. We capture these factors by proposing a modified wiring cost function.},

@article{Varshney2011,
abstract = {Despite recent interest in reconstructing neuronal networks, complete wiring diagrams on the level of individual synapses remain scarce and the insights into function they can provide remain unclear. Even for Caenorhabditis elegans, whose neuronal network is relatively small and stereotypical from animal to animal, published wiring diagrams are neither accurate nor complete and self-consistent. Using materials from White et al. and new electron micrographs we assemble whole, self-consistent gap junction and chemical synapse networks of hermaphrodite C. elegans. We propose a method to visualize the wiring diagram, which reflects network signal flow. We calculate statistical and topological properties of the network, such as degree distributions, synaptic multiplicities, and small-world properties, that help in understanding network signal propagation. We identify neurons that may play central roles in information processing, and network motifs that could serve as functional modules of the network. We explore propagation of neuronal activity in response to sensory or artificial stimulation using linear systems theory and find several activity patterns that could serve as substrates of previously described behaviors. Finally, we analyze the interaction between the gap junction and the chemical synapse networks. Since several statistical properties of the C. elegans network, such as multiplicity and motif distributions are similar to those found in mammalian neocortex, they likely point to general principles of neuronal networks. The wiring diagram reported here can help in understanding the mechanistic basis of behavior by generating predictions about future experiments involving genetic perturbations, laser ablations, or monitoring propagation of neuronal activity in response to stimulation.},

abstract = {We provide an asymptotically justified derivation of activity measure evolution equations (AMEEs) for a finite size neural network. The approach takes into account the dynamics for each isolated neuron in the network being modeled by a biophysical model, i.e., Hodgkin--Huxley equations or their reductions. By representing the interacting network as self- and pairwise-interactions, we propose a general definition of spatial projections of the network, called activity measures, that quantify the activity of a network. We show that the evolution equations that govern the dynamics of the activity measure shadow the activity measure of the network (i.e., the two quantities stay close to each other for all times) for general interactions and various asymptotic dynamics. The AMEEs effectively serve as a dimensionality reduction technique for the complex network when spatial synchrony and coherence are present and allow us to a priori predict network dynamics that would not be guessed from individual neuron behav...},

@article{Chalfie1985,
abstract = {The neural pathways for touch-induced movement in Caenorhabditis elegans contain six touch receptors, five pairs of interneurons, and 69 motor neurons. The synaptic relationships among these cells have been deduced from reconstructions from serial section electron micrographs, and the roles of the cells were assessed by examining the behavior of animals after selective killing of precursors of the cells by laser microsurgery. This analysis revealed that there are two pathways for touch-mediated movement for anterior touch (through the AVD and AVB interneurons) and a single pathway for posterior touch (via the PVC interneurons). The anterior touch circuitry changes in two ways as the animal matures. First, there is the formation of a neural network of touch cells as the three anterior touch cells become coupled by gap junctions. Second, there is the addition of the AVB pathway to the pre-existing AVD pathway. The touch cells also synapse onto many cells that are probably not involved in the generation of movement. Such synapses suggest that stimulation of these receptors may modify a number of behaviors.},
