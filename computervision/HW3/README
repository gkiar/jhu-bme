Computer Vision - HW 3

Execution instructions for programs developed:

Q1
a) Execute file titled "hw3q1a.m". To iterate through each plotting of the RANSAC method, the pause function was used. This means that a key must be pressed to step through the iterations of the algorithm. At the end of these, the final result is displayed.
b) No code
c) Exectue file titled "hw2q1c.m". To iterate through each plotting of the RANSAC-M method, the pause function was again used. At the end of the iterations, the final result is displayed.
d) Exectue file titled "hw3q1d.m". To iterate through each image with RANSAC-M applied, the pause function was used. This version was modified from the original RANSAC in that no intermediate plots are displayed (you're welcome).

Q2
a) Execute file titled "hw3q2a.m". To iterate through all of the parameters of w and kappa, the pause function is again used. As mentioned in class, the supression vs. non-supression was more of a teaching tool to view our results than a real output, so I did not plot unsupressed values.
b) function not run on its own
c) Execute file titled "hw3q2c.m". The pause function was again used, so I think you get the drill at this point... Also, note, it takes a fair bit of time to process since sooo many corners were detected in both of the images (per pair).
