# JHU BME MSE Coursework

This repo is intended to house coursework that I (and perhaps some of my peers) complete during our studies @ JHU, and share them with others. Since this is personal work, I've imposed an Apache license which states that you can use whatever you want but you must give credit (i.e. no plagiarizing).

The courses for which resourses exist here are:
EN.580.422: Systems Bioengineering II
EN.580.429: Systems Bioengineering III
EN.580.639: Models of the Neuron
EN.600.661: Computer Vision
EN.550.631: Statistical Theory II

Coming soon:
EN.580.694: Statistical Connectomics (work is in another repo, https://github.com/Statistical-Connectomics-Sp15/coursework)

If you have courses that you'd like to share your work for and possibly help out your peers, please send me a line to contribute!

Cheers,
G
