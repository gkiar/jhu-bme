# JHU BME MSE Coursework

This repo is intended to house coursework that my peers and I complete during our studies @ JHU, and share it with others. Since this is personal work, I've imposed an Apache license to the repository which states that you can use whatever you want but you must give credit (i.e. plagiarize at your own risk).

The courses documented here are: <br/>

EN.580.422: Systems Bioengineering II (Spring 2015, gkiar)<br/>
EN.580.429: Systems Bioengineering III (Fall 2014, gkiar)<br/>

If you have courses and work that you'd like to share and possibly help out your peers, please send me an email to contribute containing the following:
* Course Code (EN.###.###)
* Course Name (Learning Things 101)
* Semester Taken (Spring 2020)
