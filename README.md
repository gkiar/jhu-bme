# JHU BME MSE Coursework

This repo is intended to house coursework that I (and perhaps some of my peers) complete during our studies @ JHU, and share them with others. Since this is personal work, I've imposed an Apache license which states that you can use whatever you want but you must give credit (i.e. no plagiarizing).

The courses documented here are: <br/>

EN.580.422: Systems Bioengineering II (Spring 2015, gkiar)<br/>
EN.580.429: Systems Bioengineering III (Fall 2014, gkiar)<br/>
EN.580.639: Models of the Neuron (Fall 2014, gkiar)<br/>
EN.600.661: Computer Vision (Fall 2014, gkiar)<br/>
EN.550.631: Statistical Theory II (Spring 2015, gkiar)<br/>

Coming soon: <br/>

EN.580.694: Statistical Connectomics (Spring 2015, gkiar) (work is in another repo, https://github.com/Statistical-Connectomics-Sp15/coursework)

If you have courses that you'd like to share your work for and possibly help out your peers, please send me a line to contribute!

Cheers,
G
